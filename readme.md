## API

### documentReady: Promise<[Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) | undefined>

`documentReady` is a `Promise` that is resolved if the HTML document has been loaded and parsed. If the hole page has not loaded, the timing is equivalent to [the `DOMContentLoaded` event of document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event).

### windowReady: Promise<[Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) | undefined>

`windowReady` is a `Promise` that is resolved if the hole page has been loaded. If the hole page has not been loaded, the timing is equivalent to [the `load` event of window](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event).
